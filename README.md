Simulation of the vibratory motion of the Duffing Oscillator using several Fourth Order Runge Kutta methods

Input.txt
File for the versions of fourth order Runge-Kutta to be used in the simulation.

ProjectDuffingOscillator.f95
FORTRAN code for the simulation of the Duffing equation.

ProjectDuffingOscillator1.f95
FORTRAN code for the simulation of the Duffing equation.

ProjectDuffingOscillator2.f95
FORTRAN code for the simulation of the Duffing equation.

ProjectDuffingOscillator3.f95
FORTRAN code for the simulation of the Duffing equation.

The simulation can be carried out using any of the ProjectDuffingOscillator.f95 files
